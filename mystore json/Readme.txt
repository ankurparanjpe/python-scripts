Things for creating Json with excel

1. Update data in excel named "Final ver 2.0.xlsx". Save and close
   - IMPORTANT: NAME SHOULD ONLY BE "Final ver 2.0.xlsx" AND SHOULD BE IN SAME PATH AS SCRIPT. IF CHANGED NEED TO UPDATE IN SCRIPT
2. Click on "excel_to_json.py". It will create a Json with with format "mystore_tv_{current_time}".

PS:
1. Script will strip left or right space from col "channelname"
2. Replace key "channelname" value to space (" ")
